            <h4>"headwatching"</h4>
            <p>
                Rock and I were on the white sofa by the tall bookshelf when the girl who in a minute would come in the front door unsure, and later tearsoaked and tearing down walls, knocked, and we were watching the Gilmore Girls. It was one of the episodes where Lorelai is renovating the old inn, which reminded me of the week Rock and I had spent remodeling our own little home, dusting and buying and rearranging and tossing out old worthless things. He wanted a new kitchen table, one with a glass top. He wanted the white sofa against the wall left of the tall bookshelf instead of in front of the window where it used to be. I agreed and didn't know why I'd ever put it there. I hate the idea of people walking by and staring at the back of my head. I've always imagined that someone looking at me from behind for long enough could see through and know what I'm thinking. That they could come in and grope around and leave oily prints on my brain—and I almost think she knew, and she wanted them to, and that's why she was so eager to put the sofa back.
                <p>That's the first thing she did when she came in, after the beginning part with the shouting and the crying—she dragged the white sofa back across the hardwood to the window. It looked easy when Rock did it but she had to strain to get the thing to budge. She looked so distraught I wanted to help her but it didn't seem appropriate, when someone had just burst into our home uninvited, helping them rearrange the furniture. She didn't seem threatening, though, so we didn't stop her right away. She just looked terribly sad. Rock and I also agreed later that she was especially pretty. 
                <p>Rock tried to talk to her, talk her into going. He got her to tell us her name. All the while she was feeling the wall behind the couch. She said we were scaring her. Rock said it was the other way round. The funny thing is she kept saying she lives here, that this is her apartment. Rock told her no, honey, you're confused. Looking at the wall she said no, she lives here. She kept touching the wall, running her hand over the patch—a few square feet, barely visible, where new paint went over old, the same color a few years removed. She was touching the wall, then scratching and pounding, desperate, pounding, and Rock was talking to her and she was pounding and she went to the closet and came back with a hammer.
                <p>We got out of the way and she started with it on the wall. I remembered then laying the drywall carefully in place, smearing plaster in the cracks, taping off the new molding to protect from paint drips, delicate work the girl now bluntly undid hammering away at the offwhite patch, a dry white cloud forming around the commotion and the pattern of a door emerging, revealing itself blow by blow.
                <br 2><p>Sure enough there it stood, not freed enough from the wall to step through but enough that when she turned the handle and the door swung inward I could see the fully-furnished room inside. You see it now, she said, you know me. You know me. I peered through the opening at the lived-in IKEA bed and shabby dresser, the frames around obscure photos, the dim alley window. Not my taste. Though of course I didn't tell her that.
                <p>While Rock was on the phone in the kitchen the girl was raving about the bookshelf in the corner. She told me a story about the two of us—me and her—going out to buy the shelf, carrying it home, trying for days to put it together. She said I must have forgotten. I told her she was confused. She said yes, she was. I said I don't know where your home is, but it isn't here. I think she understood, but then it's hard to tell with people like her.
                <p>The police arrived later. By then Rock had quieted the girl some and she went without protest. She'd brought a rugged roller suitcase with her which til now had slumped sadly in the foyer, and they took that too. There had been moments where I wished Rock would just haul her out of the apartment, take her in his heavy arms and throw her shameful kicking body out into the street—it would have solved the problem quicker—but in the end I admired how he handled the situation without force. I love him for his peace and for his restraint, and I'm fortunate to have someone so level-headed and kind in my life.
