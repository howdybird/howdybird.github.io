            <h4>"Teeth"</h4>
            <p>Teeth is a game for two players. It is played using a standard deck of 54 playing cards (including 2 jokers).</p>
            <p>Teeth is about reading your opponent and determining what cards they have based on their decisions.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To set up a round of Teeth, deal 9 cards in a 3-by-3 rectangle, with the middle row face-up and the top and bottom rows face-down. Like this:</p>
            <p>[o] [o] [o]</p>
            <p>[x] [x] [x]</p>
            <p>[o] [o] [o]</p>
            <p>Players should sit opposite each other so that each player has a row of face-down cards directly in front of them.</p>
            <p>Place the rest of the deck face-down so both players can access it. There will also be a face-up discard pile next to the deck, but there is no need to put any cards in the discard pile before play begins.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You may, at any time, look at any of the face-down cards in the row in front of you. However, you may not look at the cards on your opponent's side.</p>
            <p>Each vertical column of cards is scored independently; you may think of them as three separate games played in parallel.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Scoring</u></p>
            <p>A column is scored bottom-to-top, in this order: [bottom] + [middle] - [top]. So, to score this column:</p>
            <p>[3]</p>
            <p>[9]</p>
            <p>[6]</p>
            <p>You would add together the two cards closest to you, 6 and 9, to get 15. Then you would subtract 3 for a total score of 12.</p>
            <p>Your opponent, since they are sitting opposite you, would score it the opposite way: 3 plus 9 minus 6 equals 6.</p>
            <p>The objective is for you to get a higher score than your opponent without going over 18. If your score is above 18 and your opponent's score is 18 or below, your opponent wins that column. Otherwise, the player with the higher score wins the column.</p>
            <p>Jacks, queens, and kings are worth 11, 12, and 13 respectively.</p>
            <p>Jokers are worth minus 4 (+4 if you're subtracting).</p>
            <p>Aces are worth either 1 or 11. The same ace can represent different values for each player. Treat an ace as whichever value is better for you.</p>
            <p>How to deal with ties is explained in the next section.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Gameplay</u></p>
            <p>You can begin your turn by drawing a card and looking at it.</p>
            <p>You may use this card to replace any of the face-up cards in the middle row. When you replace a card, put it in the discard pile and put the new card face-up in its place. This can change the scoring of the column in your favor. For instance, imagine you are dealt the column on the left, then you replace the 2 with a king.</p>
            <p>[9]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[9]</p>
            <p>[2] &gt;&gt; [K]</p>
            <p>[3]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[3]</p>
            <p>Your score has changed from -4 to 7. Your opponent's score has changed from 8 to 19. In both cases your opponent's score is higher than yours, but since your opponent's score is now over 18, you have the advantage. Here's another example:</p>
            <p>[K]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[K]</p>
            <p>[9] &gt;&gt; [A]</p>
            <p>[3]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[3]</p>
            <p>In this case, your opponent replaces the 7 in the middle with an ace. In the column shown on the left, your score is -2 and your opponent's is 20. In the column on the right, after your opponent plays the ace, your score would be either 1 (3 + 11 - 13) or -9 (3 + 1 - 13). You would take the better score, 0. Your opponent's score is either 21 (13 + 11 - 3) or 11 (13 + 1 - 3). They would take the better score, 11, giving them the advantage over you.</p>
            <p>Bear in mind that you will not be able to see the cards in your opponent's row, so you will only be able to guess their values.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>Double down:</em></p>
            <p>After drawing a card, instead of replacing one of the cards in the middle, you can add your new card face-up to the bottom of one of the three columns. You will now add that card's value to the value of the face-down card that's already there. Your opponent will also now subtract that card's value from their total score for the column. So, a column might then look like this:</p>
            <p>[Q] (opponent's row, face down)</p>
            <p>[2] (middle row, face up)</p>
            <p>[4] (your row, face down)</p>
            <p>[9] (new card, face up)</p>
            <p>Your score here would be 3 (9 + 4 + 2 - 12) and your opponent's would be 1 (12 + 2 - 4 - 9).</p>
            <p>You are allowed to add multiple extra cards to a single row.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you draw a card and don't want to do anything with it, you may discard it and end your turn.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>Score:</em></p>
            <p>Instead of drawing a card to start your turn, you can initiate scoring of a column by flipping over your face-down card at the bottom of that column. Then your opponent must flip over the corresponding card on their side. Whichever player has the better score stacks up the cards in the column and keeps it. The winner of the game will be determined by who has collected the most columns at the end.</p>
            <p>If the score of a column is tied, or if both players bust (go over 18), the player who initiated the scoring by flipping over their card first loses the column, and the other player takes it.</p>
            <p>Scoring a column takes up your full turn.<br /> </p>
            <p>After all three columns are scored, you may start another round by dealing 9 more cards. If you keep the stack of columns you've won and deal from the remainder of the deck, then you can play through the whole deck and the game will be over once all the cards have been collected by the players. I think this is elegant and keeps the game to a good length. You may also play in a more continuous way where a new column is dealt each time one is scored. However, if you were to play this game more seriously it might be wiseto keep score on paper and reshuffle the entire deck each round.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><u>Other notes</u></p>
            <p>This game's playtesting has been limited, so I can't say whether altering the rules might lead to a more fruitful experience. You may wish to experiment with things like:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p>Changing the point values of face cards (all worth 10 rather than 11, 12, 13)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Changing the value of jokers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Changing the score limit to something other than 18</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Playing with more or fewer columns</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you find the game functions much better after making such changes, I would welcome a message via email so that I can repeat your experiments!</p>
