            <h4>"skin"</h4>
            <p>I wake up but my eyes don't open. This is pretty typical. Everything hurts. Spaces inside my body fill with pressure during the night. It feels like there's a muscle cramping hard somewhere behind my face, pulling my eyes and tongue farther back into my skull. It's my bladder, radiating its sticky ache across my abdomen, that compels me finally to heave myself off the mattress. I feel a jolt, and hear a thud, that let me know my feet have hit the floor. My blurry sliver of vision flickers over the carpet, the dust and flakes of detritus that coat my habitual paths through the apartment. In the bathroom my head spins and I piss a guttering, uneven stream.</p>
            <p>I've been having this problem recently where I can't return texts. The skin on my fingers, as far as I can figure, is thick enough at this point that it's not conductive. It's a little frustrating. The phone keeps buzzing but I can't get in through the touchscreen.</p>
            <p>Lately I've stopped washing my hands. I still use the time I would have, but I just look at myself in the mirror.</p>
            <p>In three years most of my body has disappeared, buried under layers of thick, rough skin. The one dermatologist I ever bothered going to told me this was neither <em>life-threatening</em> nor <em>cur</em><em>able</em>. And so I've gone on living as normal, gradually thickening. My face in the mirror is doughy, indistinct. It takes longer than usual to find my eyes, sunken in wells of hardening skin. Around my neck, armpits, breasts, parts are cracked, whitening, starting to peel back. I lean in closer to the face. In the pale mass I can almost see the contours of round cheeks, the curve of a nose, a mouth that closed fully and smiled.</p>
            <p>The phone growls from the counter. <em>hey!! i know we haven't talked in a while, but we should[...]</em></p>
            <p>I pick it up and put it down again.</p>
            <p>There's a long hatpin in the plastic cup on the sink, along with a neglected toothbrush. I close the head of it between three clumsy fingers. I push the pin into my right arm, above the elbow. It goes in smoothly, like it would into dirt. White dust gathers around the hole. It goes in almost an inch before I can feel it.</p>
