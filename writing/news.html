                <b>3 Great Tricks for Improv Comedy Beginners</b><br>
                <i>Petey Jeter</i><br><br>
                <p>There are no two ways about it: improv comedy is hard. When you're just starting out, watching improv experts at work can be intimidating. Believe me, I know — I've been an improviseur for over a decade and I still get the ol' terror cramps before practice. But it gets better, trust me — and in the meantime, it helps to know a few of the tricks that seasoned improv pros use to keep the scene rolling.
                <h6>1. The "Old Man"</h6>
                <p>One of the most useful techniques in improv is playing characters, and the Old Man is one of the best characters to play. This takes a little practice, but it can be achieved by hunching over slightly and doing a voice like an old man's voice. Other improv characters you can practice are "Child" and "Foreigner."
                <h6>3. The "Pee" bit</h6>
                <p>A "bit" is what improv professionals call a joke. A common improv technique your scene partner might use on you is to pantomime (pretend) to give you a beverage (e.g. milk or water). The best response to this is to pretend to take a drink of the beverage, make a disgusted face, and say, "This... is PEE!" Audiences love this. You can also do this multiple times in a show to create what's known as a "running gag."
                <h6>2. The "Shrek"</h6>
                <p>This is a great way to add momentum to a scene that's stagnating. When you feel a lull, point over your scene partner's shoulder and say "Look! It's Shrek!" Shrek is a well-known comedy character that's always sure to get a laugh. You can also do this multiple times in a show to create what's known as a "standing ovation."
                <br><br>
                <p>Improv is the most difficult art form, and it takes decades to hone your skills. These tips will get you some of the way, but they can't make you a master — there are over a dozen more improv techniques that you'll have to learn before you can earn that title. This is only the beginning of your improv journey. Good luck, friend.

                <h5>Inside the War Room with George W. Bush</h5>
                <p>Recent testimonies from former members of the Bush administration have revealed that plans for a campaign similar to the War On Terror were discussed months before the 9/11 attacks took place. Inspired by Reagan's War On Drugs, Bush believed he could ensure his re-election by uniting America against a common enemy. According to former top advisors, some of the political campaigns proposed by the President were as follows:

                <h6>The War On Ghosts</h6>
                <p>The former president allegedly brought up the concept of a "War On Ghosts" multiple times in cabinet meetings; he believed that the American people had a deep-seated fear of ghosts that could be leveraged politically. Some of the alleged ghosts proposed by President Bush were "No-head Humphrey," a headless phantom who would frighten children, "the Guzzler," a ghost who would eat oil and increase gas prices, and the ghost of Joseph Stalin.
                
                <h6>The War On Ice</h6>
                <p>Reports from advisors allege that, in meetings with advisors, Mr. Bush repeatedly suggested his idea for a "War On Ice," which would reframe the growing issue of climate change as a successful anti-ice offensive. One source said Bush planned to perform a stunt on national TV wherein he would stick his tongue to a frozen streetlamp to demonstrate the threat imposed by ice against the American people.
                
                <h6>The War On The Old</h6>
                <p>Former aides recall that Bush would constantly pester the Vice President about implementing a "War On The Old," a speculative campaign that would attempt to paint elderly Americans as an existential threat to the nation. Bush reportedly cited their "wrinkly necks" and "freaky leg veins" as possible angles, but was discouraged from pursuing the concept further after staff reminded him that he, too, would one day become old.

                <b>3 Rotten DIY Ideas From My Stinking Gourd</b><br>
                <i>Judy Blugg</i><br><br>
                <p><em>1. Recycled Jam Jars</em></p>
                <p>Have you ever ploughed through a whole jar of jam like a disgusting feral hog and then just thrown away the jar? Well, next time, consider keeping it around &mdash; old jars can actually be SO useful! Just wash out the leftover jam and presto &mdash; you can keep jewelry in there, or yogurt, or even leftover oatmeal! And it doesn't stop there &mdash; there are almost half a dozen other uses! Personally, I like to mix together rice and mayonnaise in a recycled jam jar for an easy go-to snack I can eat throughout the week. I barely even cook anymore! Maybe you're asking, Judy, did I really need to be told that I can put things in old jars? I'll answer with a question: if not, why am I even alive?</p>
                <p><em>2. DIY Mustards</em></p>
                <p>Afraid your cooking lacks style? So was I! I used to dread the looks on my girls' faces when I would serve them hot dog wedges with regular yellow mustard &mdash; pure contempt! They saw right through me &mdash; right into the vacant, fetid cavity at my center! Nothing says "my heart is a pit of decay and my very existence is immoral" like hot dog wedges and yellow mustard. But here's an easy fix: mix up mustard with other regular household condiments &mdash; my personal favorites are honey and mayo &mdash; to create a brand-new exciting condiment your kids will love! "Wow," they'll say, "looks like Mom isn't a shambling carcass masquerading as a real person after all!" Although, of course, you can't fool them forever.</p>
                <p><em>3. Silly Soup Can Characters</em></p>
                <p>I'm a fraud. I drew a face on a soup can and it's a more convincing person than I am. I should be in jail.</p>

                <h5>A Guide To Self-Defense Against The Buddha</h5>
                <p><em>If you meet the Buddha, kill him.</em> &mdash;临济义玄</p>
                <p>The Buddha died over a hundred years ago. That fact might make some of you feel safe. This is foolish, however, as it neglects to account for one of the Buddha's most powerful abilities: reincarnation. The fact is, the Buddha may still be alive today &mdash; and he could be anywhere. So, I've compiled this list of tips that you can use in the event that you find yourself in a combat situation with the Buddha, which, again, could happen at any moment.</p>
                <p><em>Identifying the Buddha</em></p>
                <p>There are no known images of the Buddha created during his lifetime, so we have the disadvantage of not knowing what he looks like. However, there are some known identifying features of the Buddha: he is believed to have a full figure, large earrings, and a jolly demeanor. If you meet someone with these characteristics, know that a combat scenario may be imminent.</p>
                <p><em>Special Abilities</em></p>
                <p>The Buddha has several powers that you should familiarize yourself with before engaging him in combat. The Buddha is known to have webbed fingers, making him extremely agile in water. Be aware also of his unusually long, sharp teeth. Perhaps the Buddha's greatest strength is his enlightenment, which grants him extreme mental capacity and lightning-fast reaction time.</p>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Warning: DO NOT attempt to capture the Buddha.</em></span></p>
                <p>As I mentioned, the Buddha does possess the power of reincarnation. Your first thought, as mine was, might be to attempt to imprison the Buddha alive to prevent him from reappearing. However, this is not recommended, as reliably containing the Buddha is nearly impossible. If you have the opportunity for a finishing blow, you should take it. It may not come again.</p>
                <p><em>Blackmail</em></p>
                <p>One of the few advantages we hold against the Buddha is knowing the identity of his secret alter ego, Siddhartha Gautama. Should you encounter the Buddha, it may be possible to leverage this information in order to avoid combat altogether. I myself have engineered a system for my own safety wherein a message containing the Buddha's identity will be sent from an encrypted email server to every major news network should I fail to complete an hourly check-in. I strongly recommend you do the same.</p>
                <p>That's all the advice I can offer &mdash; though it may not be enough. Stay safe, and good luck.</p>

                <b>The Gogan Revue: "Holy Glory"</b><br>
                <i>Tim Gogan</i><br><br>
                <p>You may remember a recent review of mine where I called Season 3 of Netflix's Paradise PD "the finest season of television ever aired." That may have been premature.</p>
                <p>The all-new streaming-exclusive adult animated series Holy Glory asks the question "what if the twelve apostles were horny... AND racist?" and honestly... it's everything. I've written the phrase "this is what America needs right now" before, but when the apostle Matthew made a joke about Elon Musk's penis in episode 2, I could feel our nation healing. The series fires off shots with laser focus at all sides of the aisle, so if you're too delicate to take a joke, you might want to sit this one out over on the gender-neutral playground. For every stab at the 1%, there's an equally playful jab at the homeless or starving children. It's a show that truly doesn't discriminate &mdash; in fact, it's actually one of the most diverse shows on TV right now, with moments of groundbreaking representation such as episode 4, "Peter's Vagina." John and James are gay with each other, and if you're thinking "hey, weren't they brothers?" well, that's just the kind of zany, no-holds-barred comedy these writers come up with. Jesus is black &mdash; and yeah, it's funny. And don't worry &mdash; just like your favorite animated series, Holy Glory has a talking animal sidekick. He's a camel, his name is Jorge, and boy, does he have a funny accent. He also suffers from depression, so I really found myself relating to him. If you're a cynical nut who's losing hope in society, like me, Tim Gogan, you need to check out Holy Glory ASAP &mdash; It's a Gogan "10."</p>
