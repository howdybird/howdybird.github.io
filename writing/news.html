                <b>3 Great Tricks for Improv Comedy Beginners</b><br>
                <i>Petey Jeter</i><br><br>
                <p>There are no two ways about it: improv comedy is hard. When you're just starting out, watching improv experts at work can be intimidating. Believe me, I know—I've been an improviseur for over a decade and I still get the ol' terror cramps before practice. But it gets better, believe me—and in the meantime, it helps to know a few of the tricks that seasoned improv pros use to keep the scene rolling.
                <h6>1. The "Old Man"</h6>
                <p>One of the most useful techniques in improv is playing characters, and the Old Man is one of the best characters to play. This takes a little practice, but it can be achieved by hunching over slightly and doing a voice like an old man's voice. Other improv characters you can practice are "Child" and "Foreigner."
                <h6>3. The "Pee" bit</h6>
                <p>A "bit" is what improv professionals call a joke. A common improv technique your scene partner might use on you is to pantomime (pretend) to give you a beverage (e.g. milk or water). The best response to this is to pretend to take a drink of the beverage, make a disgusted face, and say, "This... is PEE!" Audiences love this. You can also do this multiple times in a show to create what's known as a "running gag."
                <h6>2. "Shrekking"</h6>
                <p>This is a great way to add momentum to a scene that's stagnating. When you feel a lull, point over your scene partner's shoulder and say "Look! It's Shrek!" Shrek is a classic comedy character that's always sure to get a laugh. You can also do this multiple times in a show to create what's known as a "standing ovation."
                <br><br>
                <p>Improv is the most difficult art form, and it takes decades to hone your skills. These tips will get you some of the way, but they can't make you a master—there are over a dozen more improv techniques that you'll have to learn before you can earn that title. This is only the beginning of your improv journey. Good luck, friend.

                <h5>Inside the War Room with George W. Bush</h5>
                <p>Recent testimonies from former members of the Bush administration have revealed that plans for a military campaign similar to the War On Terror were discussed months before the 9/11 attacks took place. Inspired by Reagan's War On Drugs, Bush believed he could ensure his re-election by uniting America against a common enemy. According to former top advisors, some of the political campaigns proposed by the President were as follows:

                <h6>George W. Bush's War On Ghosts</h6>
                <p>The former president allegedly brought up the concept of a "War On Ghosts" multiple times in cabinet meetings; he believed that the American people had a deep-seated fear of ghosts that could be leveraged politically. Some of the alleged ghosts proposed by President Bush were "No-head Humphrey," a headless phantom who would frighten children, "the Guzzler," a ghost who would eat oil and increase gas prices, and the ghost of Karl Marx.
                
                <h6>President George W. Bush's War On Ice</h6>
                <p>Reports from advisors allege that, in meetings with advisors, Mr. Bush repeatedly suggested his idea for a "War On Ice," which would reframe the growing issue of climate change as an ideological conflict. One source said Bush planned to perform a stunt on national TV wherein he would stick his tongue to a frozen streetlamp to demonstrate the threat imposed by ice against the American people.
                
                <h6>President Bush's War On The Old</h6>
                <p>Former aides recall that Bush would constantly pester the Vice President about implementing a "War On The Old," a speculative campaign that would attempt to paint elderly Americans as an existential threat to the nation. Bush reportedly cited their "wrinkly necks" and "freaky leg veins" as possible angles, but was discouraged from pursuing the concept further after staff reminded him that he, too, would one day become old.
